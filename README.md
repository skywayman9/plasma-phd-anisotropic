# plasma-phd-anisotropic

I developed these codes during my PhD, solving diffusion and anisotropic diffusion using the hyperbolic approach.

Anisotropic diffusion was typically seen in high-temperature plasmas, heat conduction in materials of varying degrees of conductivity and porous media flows.
The primary objective of the work was to model Hall-thrusters, electric propulsion devise used in satellites, but it was successful only to an extent, and extensions are possible but difficult.

Details are in the papers which are published in JCP.

I haven't looked at these codes in 3 years as I moved to a different field. If you find them helpful, use them, but if they don't work for your case, please don't blame me.

Good luck!
